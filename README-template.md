## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

This was an easy challenge and I didn't much things because this project is already to apply the basics of HTML and CSS!

### Useful resources

I only used ChatGPT just to realize that I can use box shadow for the black shadow thing instead of making a whole new div and using position codes to place it.
